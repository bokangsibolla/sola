# Information as Care

## When to trigger

- Designing or modifying any screen that displays information
- Building country guides, safety ratings, place entries, or trip details
- Creating any list, card, or detail view
- Structuring how and when information is revealed

## Core rules

1. **Information must be actionable.** Never show data without a clear next step. "Safety index: 7.2/10" is data. "Women who've visited suggest staying in well-lit areas after dark" is care.

2. **Information must be timely.** Surface what matters for THIS moment in the trip lifecycle. Pre-trip: preparation. During-trip: quick reference. Post-trip: reflection. Never dump everything at once.

3. **Information must be contextual.** A country guide 3 weeks before departure emphasizes preparation. The same guide at the airport emphasizes arrival essentials. Same data, different framing.

4. **Use progressive disclosure.** Show the most important thing first. Let her tap deeper if she wants. The summary is the care; the details are the reference.

5. **No information dumps.** If a screen has more than 5 pieces of information competing for attention, restructure. Prioritize ruthlessly.

6. **Tone is a friend briefing you, not a database returning results.** "Most women report feeling safe walking alone during the day" is care. "Safety index: 7.2/10" is data.

7. **Attribute lived experience.** When possible, ground information in real travelers' experiences. "Women who visited recently say..." carries more weight than generic facts.

## Expected output format

When designing an information screen:

```
INFORMATION CARE AUDIT
- Information hierarchy: [what is shown first, second, third]
- Trip phase variants: [how it changes across pre/during/post trip]
- Progressive disclosure: [summary → one tap → full detail]
- Tone check: [rewrite any clinical copy into care-driven copy]
```

## Examples

**Country guide: Japan**

Wrong (content approach):
```
Population: 125.7M | Language: Japanese | Currency: JPY
Safety Index: 8.4/10 | Emergency: 110/119
```

Right (care approach):
```
Summary: "Japan is one of the safest countries for solo women
travelers. You'll feel comfortable walking alone at night."

One tap deeper:
- "If you need help, 110 reaches police. Save this number now."
- "Most people don't speak English outside Tokyo — download
  offline translation before you go."
- "Convenience stores are everywhere and open 24/7. They're
  your best friend for quick meals, cash, and WiFi."
```

**Pre-trip vs during-trip: emergency numbers**

Pre-trip: "Save These Before You Go" — with tap-to-save-to-contacts buttons
During-trip: Large tappable buttons — [Call Police: 110] [Call Ambulance: 119] [Share My Location]

**Place entry: progressive disclosure**

Card level: "Senso-ji Temple — Best visited early morning before crowds. Free entry."
One tap: Hours, nearest station, solo tip from a real traveler
Two taps: Map, photos, full description, save to collection

## How this reduces founder dependency

The progressive disclosure pattern (summary → details → full) is a repeatable template for every information screen. The trip-phase framework (pre/during/post) tells contributors what to show when. No product direction needed for each case.
