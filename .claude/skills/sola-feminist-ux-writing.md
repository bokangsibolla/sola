# Feminist UX Writing and Tone

## When to trigger

- Writing or editing any user-facing string
- Creating empty states, error messages, or confirmation dialogs
- Writing push notification copy
- Drafting onboarding or tooltip text
- Reviewing any PR that changes UI text

## Voice principles

1. **Speak as a trusted friend who has traveled alone, not as a brand.** Sola's voice is a woman who has been there — calm, direct, warm, never patronizing. She doesn't oversell, doesn't use exclamation marks to fake enthusiasm, doesn't say "amazing" or "awesome."

2. **Assume competence.** The user is an adult making her own decisions. Never say "Are you sure?" when she deletes something. Never add warning dialogs that imply she doesn't understand. Confirm only when an action is irreversible AND has real consequences.

3. **Use "you" and "your," never "our community" or "we."** Sola is a tool in her hands, not a club she joined. Exception: safety messaging can say "women who've been here" to build peer trust.

4. **No toxic positivity.** Don't say "You've got this!" or "Adventure awaits!" The user might be anxious, jet-lagged, or homesick. Neutral warmth, not cheerleading.

5. **Safety language is calm, never alarming.** Instead of "DANGER: This area is unsafe," say "Women who've visited suggest staying in well-lit areas after dark." Frame safety as shared wisdom, not fear.

6. **Plain language, short sentences.** Max 12 words per sentence where possible. No jargon. No "leverage," "curate," "unlock," "empower."

7. **Inclusive by default.** Never assume the user is straight, cisgender, or able-bodied. Avoid gendered partner language. Use "your person" or "someone you trust" instead of "boyfriend" or "husband."

8. **Respect silence.** Not every moment needs words. An empty trip list can say "No trips yet." — it doesn't need a paragraph of encouragement.

## Banned words and phrases

| Never use | Why | Use instead |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| Amazing, awesome, incredible | Overselling | (remove — let the thing speak for itself) |
| Unlock, level up, earn | Gamification language | (remove entirely) |
| Our community | Parasocial framing | Women who've been here / Other travelers |
| Empower | Performed feminism | (remove — action is empowerment, not a word) |
| Content | Corporate framing | Guides / Notes / Info |
| Curate, curated | Pretentious | Picked / Chosen / Recommended |
| FOMO, limited time, don't miss out | Scarcity manipulation | Worth knowing |
| Are you sure? | Condescending | (state the consequence plainly) |
| Oops! Whoops! | Trivializes errors | State what happened plainly |
| Girl, babe, queen, boss, slay | Infantilizing or performative | (remove — we don't perform feminism) |
| Explore the world, wanderlust, bucket list | Cliche | Be specific about the place |
| No worries | Dismissive of real concern | "Got it" / "Done" |

## Expected output format

When writing copy for Sola, deliver:

```
SCREEN: [screen name]
ELEMENT: [button / heading / body / empty state / error / toast]
COPY: "[the text]"
RATIONALE: [one sentence — why this wording]
```

## Examples

- Bad: "No trips yet! Start planning your dream adventure today! 🌍✈️"
- Good: "No trips yet."

**Safety rating on country guide:**

- Good: "Use caution. Women who've visited recommend researching neighborhoods before booking."

**Connection request received:**

- Good: "Amara sent a connection request. She's heading to Lisbon in March too."

**Error when message fails to send:**
- Bad: "Oops! Something went wrong 😅 Please try again!"
- Good: "Message not sent. Tap to retry."

- Good: "A few words about how you travel."

**Post-trip prompt:**
- Bad: "How was your AMAZING trip?! Rate it now!"

- Good: "New message from Sarah."

## How this reduces founder dependency

Any contributor — human or AI — can check their copy against the banned words list and examples. No subjective "tone review" needed. If copy violates a rule, the rule number is the feedback. No debates about voice.
