OPPORTUNITIES
• Build a "safety score" feature using community data before Google dominates this space
• Create Thailand digital nomad content package — visa guide + verified accommodations + community tips
• Partner with Hostelworld or similar for women-only dorm data integration

RISKS & WATCHOUTS
• Google Maps adding safety features = direct competition on our core value prop
• AI travel startup funding means more well-funded competitors in personalized travel
• Thailand visa policy may change — don't over-invest in content before details are final

ONE EXPERIMENT TO RUN THIS WEEK
• Post a community thread asking "What safety info do you wish Google Maps showed?" — use responses to shape our safety feature roadmap
